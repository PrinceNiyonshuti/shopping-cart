# 1. Problems and findings

## Problems

- Adding data to array from another components
- maintaining the state of the components when you add or delete new data
- handle price and cart size data on navbar
- render data without reloading app

## Findings

- React useEffect to handle data before data loads to the DOM and after it loads
- using Json Server to hold data to be used while fetching them like an API
- using Reach history to reload or push to a new route using the history prop
- handling and mastering use of the state and conditional rendering
- concatinated script to watch json server and run app into single script
- get data from api call and make a limit of data to retrieve
- used a function to load all data and render them
